## Summary 
Learning Redux - [Basic Tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial)

- Actions 
- Reducers
- Store
- Presentational Components vs Containers Compontents (React)

### Actions 
Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store.

### Reducers
Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Remember that actions only describe what happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.

### Store 
The Store is the object that brings actions and reducers together. The store has the following responsibilities:

- Holds application state;
- Allows access to state via getState();
- Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);
- Registers listeners via subscribe(listener);
- Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).

### Presentational Components
Purpose: How things look (markup, style)
Aware of Redux: No
To read data: Read data from props
To change data: Invoke callbacks from props
Are written: By hand

### Containers Compontents
Purpose: How things work (data fetching, state updates)
Aware of Redux: Yes
To read data: Subscribe to Redux state
To change data:  Dispatch Redux actions
Are written: Usually generated by React Redux

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
